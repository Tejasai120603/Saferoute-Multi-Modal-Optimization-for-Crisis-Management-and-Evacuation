# SafeRoute: Multi-Modal Optimization for Crisis Management and Evacuation

SafeRoute is an integrated disaster management system designed to enhance response efficiency during crises like floods and earthquakes. By leveraging machine learning, geospatial technologies, and multi-modal route optimization, the project provides real-time safe route guidance, predicts disaster severity, and facilitates efficient resource allocation to minimize casualties and damages.

## üöÄ Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a unified solution for disaster management that:
-   **Predicts** the impact of floods and earthquakes using trained machine learning models.
-   **Optimizes** evacuation and supply routes using a multi-modal approach (roadways, airways, waterways).
-   **Provides** a user-friendly interface for civilians to report their location, receive alerts, and get safe route suggestions.
-   **Enhances** real-time decision-making for disaster response teams by allocating resources effectively.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Dual Disaster Models**: High-accuracy prediction models for both earthquakes (92.60% accuracy) and floods (91.88% accuracy).
-   **Multi-Modal Route Planning**: Implements A*, Dijkstra, and Floyd-Warshall algorithms to find the fastest and safest routes across different modes of transport.
-   **Real-Time Alerts & Monitoring**: Integrates with live APIs (GPS, weather) to provide dynamic updates on risks, routes, and safe zones.
-   **Interactive User Interface**: A simple GUI allows users to input their location, get predictions, and view optimized routes on a map.
-   **Resource Allocation**: A system to manage and transfer supplies from less-affected areas to heavily impacted ones.
